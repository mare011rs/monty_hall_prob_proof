# Proof of a Monty Hall problem with python

###[Monty Hall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem):
"Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?"

Probability shows us that switching our choice will ensure that we are right 66.6% of the time and staying with our initial pick will make us right 33.3% of the time, and this piece of code proves it.
