# Proof of a Monty Hall problem with python

I found this problem very interesting so I decided to try to prove it with python.

### [Monty Hall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem):

> Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three
> doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a
> door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors,
> opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you,
> "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch
> your choice?

Probability shows that switching our choice will ensure that we are correct 66.6% of the time and staying with our initial pick will make us right 33.3% of the time, and this code proves it.
