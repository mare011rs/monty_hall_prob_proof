# Proof of a Monty Hall problem with python

I wrote this becasue I found the [Monty Hall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) very interesting and wanted to see if it could be proven using simple code.

This code proves that the first choice will be correct approximately 33.33% of the time, and if the "player" were to switch their choice after the "host" has uncovered one of the wrong answers it would result in 66.67% chance of winning the prize.
